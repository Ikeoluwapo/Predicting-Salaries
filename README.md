# Predicting-Salaries
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a model to predict the salary a person should get based on his or her years of experience).

## Dataset Overview
Name: Salary_Data

Format: CSV (Comma Separated Values)

Size: [454 bytes]

Columns: [YearsExperience, Salary] 

## Skills Demonstrated
* Feature Analysis
* Data profiling, Standardization, Normalization, 
* Models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naives Bayes
* Model training, testing and predicting
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), mean_absolute_error (MAE), r2_score
* Visualization, merging, joining using pandas and matplot libraries

## Insight
1. Numerical models were used to predict the dependent variable

2. The result came out as an estimate not binary. 

3. Several models were tried to get the best.

4. The KNN Regressor and Linear Regressor model were the best models having the same highest R-squared of 0.9660810812028866, and least rmse, mse and mae of 3913.790979594582, 15317759.831955917 and 3220.5454545454536 respectively.
